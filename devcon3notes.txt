DevCon3 LiveStream

My notes of e.g. URLs, and hours/minutes/seconds positions in the livestream archives.

I have watched almost ALL of the talks in the DevCon livestream (Main Hall), only the first evening not yet - after a long day in the office ... in the middle of it I just slept in. Will watch them later.

This is a completely idiosyncratic subset of talks. Roughly chronological. There were many more, which I did not write down anything about. Find them yourself:
 
* https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon3/agenda/
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNOfzGXD_C9YMYmnefmPH0g

Purposes of this document:
* other people can already start watching now, even before the talks are edited and published
* myself I will more easily find stuff later.
* keep the mentioned links somewhere. 

Most urgent TODO: Markdown formatting. Not sure when/if I ever find the time. So: You just go ahead, and improve this if you want to; perhaps add your own notes, do a pull request, whatever. Just one wish: If you add & edit, please do not write their email addresses in cleartext, to hide them from spambots. Thanks.

Really looking forward to the last day tomorrow. Join us in chat https://gitter.im/ethereum-unofficial/devcon if you read this in time.

What a pity I cannot party with you in Cancun now. Greetings from London.

Good night, 
AndreasKrueger

Most urgent TODO: Markdown formatting. Not sure when/if I ever find the time. So: You just go ahead, and improve this if you want to; perhaps add your own notes, do a pull request, whatever. https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/devcon3 Just one wish: If you add & edit, please do not write their email addresses in cleartext, to hide them from spambots. You find examples for that in it already. Thanks.

They seem to now have f**ked with their youtube videos, *grrr*; sabotageurs. It might be that ALL of the &t=3h20m30s are wrong now.  Checked these so far:

* Day2 afternoon: add 25 minutes, so e.g. watch?v=aMs0wAFIu7I&t=3h20m30s becomes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMs0wAFIu7I&t=3h45m23s

Some interesting talks of today.


1:00 pm - 1:40 pm Swarm Development Update
I had made notes, the first one being: "Part 4 of the SWARM talk. Encryption, Merkle tree "subdirectories" - might be inspiring our own solutions ... (ACL) Access Control List for distributed systems..."

Now stupidly, Youtube seems to cut at 04:00:00 hours? So exactly that part is missing. No replacement for being in Cancun.
