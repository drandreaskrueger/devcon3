# DevCon3 LiveStream

Notes of memorable talks.  

e.g. mentioned URLs & addresses  
e.g. youtube start positions (hours/minutes/seconds in the livestream archives) <-- this is the main usefulness.

Almost ALL of the talks in the DevCon livestream (Main Hall only). Yes, 35 hours of [binge-watching :-) ](https://twitter.com/j32804/status/926900616592490497) .

Beware: These notes contain only an idiosyncratic *subset* of talks. Roughly chronological. There were many more. Find them yourself (and if your favorites are missing, just add'em):
 
* https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon3/agenda/
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNOfzGXD_C9YMYmnefmPH0g

Purposes of this text:

* other people can already start watching now, even before the talks are edited and published. Thus the youtube URLs with exact HOUR:MINUTES:SECONDS links.  
* myself I will more easily find stuff later. 
* placeholders to perhaps insert more info about each talk  
* keeping the mentioned links somewhere. There is so much happening.  
  

There might be some more info in the chat https://gitter.im/ethereum-unofficial/devcon (please create an official chatroom).

What a pity my body was not in Cancun, but you can be sure - my mind was. Greetings from London.

Good night,  
Andreas Krueger
