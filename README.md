# DevCon3 LiveStream
watching 4 whole days of live stream, some memorable talks: notes e.g. URLs &amp; youtube positions (hours/minutes/seconds in the livestream archives)

I have watched almost ALL of the talks in the DevCon livestream (Main Hall), only the first evening not yet - after a long day in the office ... in the middle of it I just slept in. Will watch them later.

This is a completely idiosyncratic subset of talks. Roughly chronological. There were many more, which I did not write down anything about. Find them yourself:
 
* https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon3/agenda/
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNOfzGXD_C9YMYmnefmPH0g

Purposes of this document:
* other people can already start watching now, even before the talks are edited and published
* myself I will more easily find stuff later.
* keep the mentioned links somewhere. 

Most urgent TODO: Markdown formatting. Not sure when/if I ever find the time. So: You just go ahead, and improve this if you want to; perhaps add your own notes, do a pull request, whatever. Just one wish: If you add & edit, please do not write their email addresses in cleartext, to hide them from spambots. Thanks.

Really looking forward to the last day tomorrow. Join us in chat https://gitter.im/ethereum-unofficial/devcon if you read this in time.

What a pity I cannot party with you in Cancun now. Greetings from London.

Good night,
