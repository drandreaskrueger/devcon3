# DevCon3 LiveStream
After watching 2.5 whole days of live stream. Notes of some memorable talks. e.g. URLs to check out &amp; youtube positions (hours/minutes/seconds in the livestream archives) <-- main use right now.

I have watched almost *all* of the talks in the DevCon livestream (Main Hall), only the first afternoon not *yet* - after a long day in the office ... in the middle of it I just slept in.

This is not complete, it is an idiosyncratic subset. Roughly chronological. There were many more, which I did not write down anything about. Find them yourself:
 
* https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon3/agenda/
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNOfzGXD_C9YMYmnefmPH0g

Purposes of this document:
* other people can already start watching now, even before the talks are edited and published. Thus the HOUR:MINUTES:SECONDS youtube URLs.
* myself I can more easily find stuff later.
* keeping the mentioned links somewhere. There is so much happening.

Most urgent TODO: Markdown formatting. Not sure when/if I ever find the time. So: You just go ahead, and improve this if you want to; perhaps add your own notes, do a pull request, whatever. Just one wish: If you add & edit, please do not write their email addresses in cleartext, to hide them from spambots. You find examples for that in it already. Thanks.

Really looking forward to the last day tomorrow. Join us in the temporary chat https://gitter.im/ethereum-unofficial/devcon if you read this in time. 

What a pity I cannot party with you in Cancun now. Greetings from London.

Good night, 
Andreas Krueger
