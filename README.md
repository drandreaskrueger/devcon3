# DevCon3 LiveStream

Notes of memorable talks. e.g. mentioned URLs and addresses &amp; start youtube positions (hours/minutes/seconds in the livestream archives) <-- this is the main usefulness.

I have watched almost ALL of the talks in the DevCon livestream (Main Hall). Yes, 35 hours of [binge-watching :-) ](https://twitter.com/j32804/status/926900616592490497) .

These notes contain an idiosyncratic *subset* of talks. Roughly chronological. There were many more. Find them yourself (and if your favorites are missing, just add'em):
 
* https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon3/agenda/
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNOfzGXD_C9YMYmnefmPH0g

Purposes of this text document:
* other people can already start watching now, even before the talks are edited and published. Thus the youtube URLs with exact HOUR:MINUTES:SECONDS links.  
* myself I will more easily find stuff later. 
* placeholders to perhaps insert more info about each talk  
* keeping the mentioned links somewhere. There is so much happening.  
  

There might be some more info in the chat https://gitter.im/ethereum-unofficial/devcon .

What a pity my body was not in Cancun, but you can be sure - my mind was. Greetings from London.

Good night, 
Andreas Krueger

#### News day 5: **twitter photos**
I have downloaded ~1000 of your beautiful [twitterphotos/](twitterphotos/) - thank you so much; that way we could see a bit more of Cancun too. Love the crocodile pictures. 

#### TODO
* Most urgent TODO: Markdown formatting. Not sure when/if I ever find the time. So: You just go ahead, and improve this if you want to; perhaps add your own notes, do a pull request, whatever. https://github.com/drandreaskrueger/devcon3  
* Just one wish: Please do not write email addresses in cleartext, to hide them from spambots (search for (at) and you'll see). Thanks. 
* making this strictly chronological  
* perhaps invent some scheme that all this can still be parsed afterwards?  

#### News day 4: *a few* times might be wrong now

Arrrghh. They seem to now have f**ked with their youtube videos, *grrr* sabotageurs. Some time positions like &t=3h20m30s are wrong now - checked only a few: 

* seems to still be correct: most of Day 2 Morning, Day 3 morning, Day 4 ?
* Day2 afternoon: have to add 25 minutes, so e.g. watch?v=aMs0wAFIu7I&t=3h20m30s becomes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMs0wAFIu7I&t=3h45m23s
* Day3 afternoon:  add 17.5 minutes so &t=02h12m03s becomes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPHXbJPVVaA&t=02h29m40s

I am not going to correct those times below just yet - because I don't know when they stop f**king with the videos.

If you do look up the correct times, please fork this repo and send a pull request. Thanks a lot.
