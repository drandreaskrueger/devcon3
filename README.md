# DevCon3 LiveStream
Binge watching 3.75 whole days of live stream.  

Notes of some memorable talks. e.g. URLs to check out &amp; youtube positions (hours/minutes/seconds in the livestream archives) <-- this is the main usefulness.


I have watched almost *all* of the talks in the DevCon livestream (Main Hall), only the first afternoon not *yet* - after a long day in the office ... in the middle of it I just slept in.

This is not complete, it is an idiosyncratic subset. Roughly chronological. There were many more, which I did not write down anything about. Find them yourself:
 
* https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon3/agenda/
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNOfzGXD_C9YMYmnefmPH0g

Purposes of this document:
* other people can already start watching now, even before the talks are edited and published. Thus the youtube URLs with exact HOUR:MINUTES:SECONDS links.
* myself I can more easily find stuff later.
* keeping the mentioned links somewhere. There is so much happening.

Really looking forward to the last day tomorrow. Join us in the temporary chat https://gitter.im/ethereum-unofficial/devcon if you read this in time. 

What a pity I cannot party with you in Cancun now. Greetings from London.

Good night, 
Andreas Krueger

### TODO
Most urgent TODO: Markdown formatting. Not sure when/if I ever find the time. So: You just go ahead, and improve this if you want to; perhaps add your own notes, do a pull request, whatever. Just one wish: If you add & edit, please do not write their email addresses in cleartext, to hide them from spambots. You find examples for that in it already. Thanks.


**News day 4:** They seem to now have f**ked with their youtube videos, *grrr*; sabotageurs. It might be that ALL of the &t=3h20m30s are wrong now?  Checked these so far:

* Day2 afternoon: have to add 25 minutes, so e.g. watch?v=aMs0wAFIu7I&t=3h20m30s becomes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMs0wAFIu7I&t=3h45m23s
* If you do look up the correct times, please fork this repo and send a pull request. Thanks a lot.
